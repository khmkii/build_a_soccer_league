# Build a Soccer League


The program reads data from a pre-supplied csv where rows hold data for a soccer player
It creates evenly matched teams based on the players heights and experience
It writes a text file for each player detailing the team they have been selected for and some details specific to each team; this could be passed onto the player (after printing)

The csv file is not included unfortunately

This was project was created as part of the coursework for a Python Techdegree
